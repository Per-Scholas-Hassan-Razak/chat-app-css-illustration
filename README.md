# Chat App CSS Illustration – SBA 3

This project is a front-end implementation of the **Chat App CSS Illustration** challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/chat-app-css-illustration-O5auMkFqY), built using **Bootstrap 5** and custom CSS.

## 🎯 Project Overview

The goal of this SBA was to accurately recreate a high-fidelity Figma design using semantic HTML and responsive CSS, applying Bootstrap’s grid system and utilities while ensuring pixel-perfect styling.

This layout simulates a chat interface between a user and a dog walker, and includes:
- A vertically stacked mobile chat mockup
- Curved background with a gradient using `clip-path`
- A right-side explanation panel (“Simple booking”) for descriptive content

## 🧠 Reflection

This project was both a design replication and layout precision challenge. The most difficult part was crafting the **purple curved background** using `clip-path` while ensuring it aligned properly behind the chat card. Fine-tuning the `ellipse()` values helped achieve the intended visual depth.

Bootstrap handled the layout structure effectively, and I used utility classes to reduce custom styling. However, achieving the “U” shaped visual arc required additional CSS and visual testing.
